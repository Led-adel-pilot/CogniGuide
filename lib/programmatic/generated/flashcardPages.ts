          "html": "Excelling in high school biology requires more than just reading the textbook; it demands deep understanding and the ability to retrieve complex information quickly, especially under exam pressure. Traditional rote memorization often fails when faced with intricate systems like metabolic pathways or taxonomy classifications. Our AI flashcard generator bridges this gap by applying established principles of cognitive science. By converting your passive notes into active recall prompts, we force your brain to work harder during study sessions, which significantly strengthens memory encoding. This process is fundamental to effective learning and directly supports better performance on quizzes and final exams."
