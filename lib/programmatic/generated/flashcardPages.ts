However, standard rote memorization methods using textbook lists are profoundly inefficient. Medical school programs cover vast datasets—from detailed cross-sections of the spinal cord to the intricate branching of the coronary arteries. Successful navigation requires mastery over pattern recognition and 3D spatial awareness, areas where traditional static flashcards fall short. We bridge this gap by leveraging principles from cognitive psychology."
