Traditional methods often rely on linear re-reading, which provides a false sense of fluency. Our approach integrates educational psychology principles directly into your study material. By converting dense text into question-and-answer formats suitable for active recall—the most potent study technique available—we shift the focus from recognition to retrieval. This intentional mental effort strengthens neural pathways far more effectively than passively reviewing highlighted notes. Whether you are tackling enzyme kinetics or cellular organization, this tool ensures you are actively engaging with the material."
